Ares Vallis, Mars<p>
[Report: ARM.001 {Sol_000}<p>
Ares Vallis is a large valley that was carved billions of years ago by water flowing across the surface of Mars. Ares Vallis (Mars Valley in Latin) is a large valley that appears to have been eroded by ancient flows of water. It is located in the Oxia Palus quadrangle, at 10.4N and 25.8 W (334.2 E)</p>
What you do get to hear about is what I tragically failed to make any mention of in my last entry, namely our support bands on this tour. First of all, AFI are with us for the whole European tour. On the opening night in Glasgow, they fucking blew me away! I've only seen them one other time since Jade has joined the band. That was in Hawaii almost a year and a half ago. Since then these guys have grown by leaps and bounds. They are more powerful than ever! I can't believe that they are able to keep the music together so tightly while running, leaping, and bouncing all over the stage like that. They mix up their set really well too, playing some older faster stuff as well as some of their slower, more dramatic, newer stuff. I love this band now more than ever, and judging from the audience responses they've been getting, so do all of you.<p>
Later,<br>
